    <pre>Rhonda prided herself on always taking the path less traveled. She'd decided to do this at an early age and had
    continued to do so throughout her entire life. It was a point of pride and she would explain to anyone who would listen
    that doing so was something that she'd made great efforts to always do. She'd never questioned this decision until her
    five-year-old niece asked her, "So, is this why your life has been so difficult?" and Rhonda didn't have an answer for
    her.</pre>

        There was a leak in the boat. Nobody had yet noticed it, and nobody would for the next couple of hours. This was a
        problem since the boat was heading out to sea and while the leak was quite small at the moment, it would be much larger
        when it was ultimately discovered. John had planned it exactly this way.
