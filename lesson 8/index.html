    Karate (空手) (/kəˈrɑːti/; Japanese pronunciation: [kaɾate] ⓘ; Okinawan pronunciation: [kaɽati]), also karate-do (空手道,
    Karate-dō), is a martial art developed in the Ryukyu Kingdom. It developed from the indigenous Ryukyuan martial arts
    (called te (手), "hand"; tī in Okinawan) under the influence of Chinese martial arts.[1][2] While modern karate is
    primarily a striking art that uses punches and kicks, traditional karate training also employs throwing and joint
    locking techniques.[3] A karate practitioner is called a karate-ka (空手家).</p>
