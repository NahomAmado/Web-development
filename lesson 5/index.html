Due to the physiological similarities between dogs and humans, dogs are useful in various types of research. Their
genome has been sequenced and due to their genetic similarities with humans, they are often used in genetic studies.
Dogs are primarily used in regulatory research, also known as toxicology or safety testing. This type of research is
required by law to test the safety and effectiveness of potential new medicines and medical devices before they are
given to human volunteers during clinical trials. Dogs are also used to test the safety and efficacy of veterinary
medicines, and also in nutrition studies to ensure that pet dogs eat healthily, particularly when they are prescribed
specialist diets by their vets.
